## Image Processing
Analyze images to get data or some transformations.

Examples:

- Image tagging
- Optical Character Recogntion (OCR): transform manuscript or scanned text into a digital version (just like CamScanner)
- Self-driving cars: scan road edges, stop signs, etc

## Text Analysis
Extract information from texts.

Examples:

- Spam filtering
- Sentiment analysis: an algorithm where it must learn to classify an opinion as positive, negative, or neutral. Such an interesting algorithm!
- Information extraction: extract particular piece of info or data

## Data Mining
The process of discovering patterns or making predictions **from data**.

Examples: 

- Anomaly detection: detect outliers (e.g. fraud detection)
- Association rules: discovering customer habits (for marketing purposes)
- Grouping: group users by their behaviour
- Predictions: predict a variable (column in a database) from the rest of the variables.

## Video Games & Robotics
ML can be used to move the robots within an environment & then generate to perform certain taks, like jumping, etc. A very popular ML technique used in these cases is **reinforcement learning**.


> A computer program is said to learn to perform a task T from experience E, if its performance at task T, as measured by a performance metric P, improves with experience E over time.

So, the more P is improved, the more we can say the the computer program has learned to perform task T.

# Categories of ML Algorithms

## Supervised Learning
Seen as a process to **transform a particular input to a desired output**

## Subtypes of Machine Learning (Classification & Regression)
### **Classification**
when the output is a discrete and finite set.
### **Regression**
when the output is a continuous number.

## Unsupervised Learning
used to discover the hidden structure and relations between the training examples, or, in short, clustering the inputs (done by **clustering algorithms**).
