# 1. Mindset

Really, there is only one thing that can stop you from getting started and getting good at machine learning.

It’s you.

    Maybe you just can’t find the motivation.
    Maybe you think you have to implement everything from scratch.
    Maybe you keep picking advanced problems rather than beginner problems to work on.
    Maybe you don’t have a systematic process to follow in order to deliver a result.
    Maybe you’re not making use of good tools and libraries.

Clear the limiting beliefs stopping you from getting started.

# 2. Pick a Process

Recommended process template:
1. Define problem
2. Prepare the data
3. Spot-check algorithms
4. Improve results
5. Present results

# 3. Pick a tool & language

These two doesn't really matter. But here are the tool choices:

1. Weka ML workbench: usually used for quick one-off modeling problems.
2. Python exosystem (pandas, scikit-learn)
3. R platform
4. Keras (for DL)
5. XGBoost (for Gradient Boosting)

Languages: Python, R

# 4. Practice on Datasets

- ![Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) 

# 5. Build portfolio

Project ideas:
- Investigate a property of a ML tool or lib.
- Investigate the bheaviour of a ML algorithm
- Investigate and characterize a dataset or ML problems.
- Implement a ML algorithm in my fav programming language.

Others:
- Coursework: notes & hw for a ML-related course.
- ML book review (notes + review)
- Software review
- Competition participation
- Commentary (an essay in response to a ML themed blog post)
